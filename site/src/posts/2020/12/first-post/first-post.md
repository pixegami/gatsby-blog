### Welcome to the Pixegami blog!

Wooo! It's my first post. I created this blog mostly so that I'd have something to do on weekends.

Other than that, there's a couple of other goals I had in mind:

- Build interesting stuff.
- Teach others.
- Improve my writing skills.

### Pixel + Origami = Pixegami!

In [Origami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami), you fold pieces of paper to make little sculptures
(mostly in the shape of animals).

Being a software engineer by trade, I liked the idea of "folding pixels" to make (techy-appy) stuff as well, so here we are.

I hope you'll find it fun and useful!
